## 2026-03-21

Major cleanup and expansion of the feed collection.

### Removed
- Entire "All Infosec | Relevant" folder (140 duplicate entries mirroring other folders)
- 83 dead feeds returning 4xx/5xx/DNS failures (FireEye, Vice, Motherboard, Threatpost, ToolsWatch, etc.)
- All Twitter and Telegram feeds (platforms killed RSS support)
- All kill-the-newsletter.com feeds (ephemeral bridges, expired)
- 5 empty folders: Reporters, Malware, Telegram, Tools, All Infosec | Relevant
- ~19 cross-folder duplicates (kept each feed in its most specific folder)

### Added
- 196 new feeds from [talkback.sh](https://talkback.sh) and [allinfosecnews](https://github.com/foorilla/allinfosecnews_sources), all verified reachable
- Notable additions: The Hacker News, SecurityWeek, Dark Reading, 404 Media, Unit 42, Rapid7, NIST, FortiGuard, Help Net Security, DFIR Report, GreyNoise, Red Canary, Datadog Security Labs, watchTowr Labs, and many more
- Python maintenance scripts (`scripts/`): `check_feeds.py`, `add_feeds.py`, `stats.py`
- uv project setup (`pyproject.toml`) for dependency and script management

### Fixed
- Security Affairs URL updated from `securityaffairs.co/wordpress/feed` to `securityaffairs.com/feed`
- `r/zeroday` htmlUrl corrected (was pointing to RSS URL instead of subreddit page)

### Net result
- 492 -> 443 feeds across 33 folders, all verified reachable
